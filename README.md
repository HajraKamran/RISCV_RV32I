RISC-V Single Cycle Processor
Welcome to the RISC-V Single Cycle Processor repository!

This repository contains the implementation of a single cycle processor based on the RISC-V instruction set architecture. The single cycle processor design provides a simple yet effective model for understanding the fundamental concepts of processor architecture and design.

Features
RISC-V ISA: Implements the RISC-V instruction set architecture, providing a standard interface for software development.
Single Cycle Execution: Each instruction is executed in a single clock cycle, simplifying the control logic and enabling a straightforward implementation.
Verilog Implementation: The processor design is implemented using Verilog HDL, making it easy to simulate and synthesize using industry-standard EDA tools.
Getting Started
To get started with the RISC-V Single Cycle Processor, follow these steps:

Clone the Repository: Clone this repository to your local machine using:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/riscv-single-cycle-processor.git
Simulate the Design: Simulate the processor design using a Verilog simulator such as ModelSim or Icarus Verilog. You can find the testbench files in the sim directory.

Synthesize the Design: Synthesize the Verilog code using synthesis tools like Synopsys Design Compiler or Xilinx Vivado for FPGA implementation.

Explore the Code: Dive into the Verilog source code to understand the implementation details of the RISC-V single cycle processor. Feel free to modify and experiment with the design.

Directory Structure
The repository is organized as follows:

rtl: Contains the Verilog source files for the RISC-V single cycle processor implementation.
sim: Contains the testbench files and simulation scripts for verifying the processor design.
docs: Contains documentation files related to the processor design.
