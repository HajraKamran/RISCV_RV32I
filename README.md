# RISC-V Single Cycle Processor

Welcome to the RISC-V Single Cycle Processor repository!

This repository contains the implementation of a single cycle processor based on the RISC-V instruction set architecture. The single cycle processor design provides a simple yet effective model for understanding the fundamental concepts of processor architecture and design.

## Features

- **RISC-V ISA**: Implements the RISC-V instruction set architecture, providing a standard interface for software development.
- **Single Cycle Execution**: Each instruction is executed in a single clock cycle, simplifying the control logic and enabling a straightforward implementation.
- **Verilog Implementation**: The processor design is implemented using Verilog HDL, making it easy to simulate and synthesize.

## Getting Started

To get started with the RISC-V Single Cycle Processor, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/HajraKamran/RISCV_RV32I.git
    ```

2. **Simulate the Design**: Simulate the processor design using a Verilog simulator such as ModelSim or Icarus Verilog.
   

3. **Explore the Code**: Dive into the Verilog source code to understand the implementation details of the RISC-V single cycle processor. Feel free to modify and experiment with the design.
